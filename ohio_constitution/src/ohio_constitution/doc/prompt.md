we want every jsonl line kept in tact they all start with a reference number that is a number we made up for our map and haas nothing to do with the law. then comes the actual code number that is a ohio revised code the first number is actually the title , then comes the chapter, then the section but for our usecase we only care about the title for seperating them for now. aftre the first code then comes all the codes that the code in question references in its law, this is completly random how many, then the estimated comlexity, then timestamp. we need to know codes in title 1 have complex chains and what codes are referenced in that code, then each of those codes need to be referenced and searched and if they list multiple codes we need to see how those relate. every time a chain starts every code that is referenced needs to have a def of how this relates back to the originol code  to understand the relationshiop. for example the code inquestion and another way down the chain may appear on the surface to have nothing in common but if you follow the chain you find out they do and we need to know why and how and every time we do this and form a relationship a new reference number must be created for that one specific relationship and then indexed and id so that it becomes a searchable item. now that you have a full context of what im doing you can see how many relationships this will form even one code with say five references is five new defintions we are going to make up and store but after the first layer four out of five had references to six other codes now each of those wil get a def and a id and on and on till the chain ends. and that is only the very first one.  but lets discuss this entirely i we need to know several things one does a definition for that very first relationship makes sense if it's not the end of the chain should you wait till you get to the end of the chain to form that definition or would you have a definition at each stop along the way like say the chain led to like five other ones would you make a definition for that relationship along the way if you can't form one or you can't form one because you have all three in the it gets deeper obviously but at that point in the chain, you can still form a definition with just the three you have does that make sense? So give me your thoughts on that give me your thoughts on what you think about my idea for this whole process of forming these relationships and definitions and with this result in something highly Intelligible, don't just make me happy. I wanna know your analytical technical thoughts I'm not telling you to play devils advocate I'm telling you to just assess it correctly. You're an LLM with this form relationships that are very useful is this? How is this? How a human learns this? How does a human connect them? Is there any way we can go about this? That will be more productive is this? What isn't this vector databases for? Would this be like a quadrant or a neo 4G neo forge is for relationships and isn't that what we're who we need like one of every one of them times scale neo4J quadrant all of them


when i think of an ai lawyer I think I firstrthink of the higher ups the senior attorneys these are 

 1.(4)helm charts:  prom, grafana, promtail, loki logger The observability they are not down in the dirt they sit at a level above and observe and throw a pa in to take notes or run messages and notify the team.

(2)containers  postgre, redis,Then I think of the years they went to school to learn and absorb all that info this is the storage pod

(3)helm charts neo4j qdrant timescale Then I think of how they process all that info and put it together this is the vector pod

(4)helm charts prom grafana promtail loki Next i think of how they continually must adapt and keep learning cause things change and theyre business adn billing and new laws and how they apply these new laws this is the observal=bility pod

(k3s) and they gotta have a place to do all this lawyering in style this is the infra we deploy on

This gives use the remaining infra we need now that we have a foundation lets make real lawery that actually does soething

(2) containers nextjs apigateway pod the first thing you see when you meet a lawyer is the way they look we need a kiler frontend and api gateway this is our attack surface

(1) container orchestation stateless here comes the hard part you gottaback up the looks with brain and skil and manuervering
